                    <p>Two years. It feels like both a blink and a lifetime. So much has happened, and through it allâ€”every joy, every struggle, every imperfect momentâ€”weâ€™ve kept choosing each other. And that means more than words can say.</p>
                  
                    <p>There were times we stumbled. Times when emotions ran high, when we tested the limits of love and patience. But somehow, we always found our way back. Back to us. Back to the love that never gave up.</p>
                  
                    <p>Youâ€™ve seen sides of me no one else has. And Iâ€™ve seen your strength, your softness, your fire, and your heart. Even in your hardest moments, I still saw the beautiful soul I fell for. And I fall for you again every day.</p>
                  
                    <p>Thank you for sticking by me. For loving me even when I was difficult to love. For showing me that real love isnâ€™t always perfectâ€”itâ€™s about growing together, even through the chaos. And God knows, weâ€™ve grown.</p>
                  
                    <p>Iâ€™m proud of us. Of what weâ€™ve built. And I know weâ€™ve still got so much aheadâ€”so many more years, more lessons, more laughter, and even more love.</p>
                  
                    <p>Hereâ€™s to more chapters in our story. I wouldnâ€™t want to write it with anyone else.</p>
                  
                    <p class="ending">I love youâ€”more than yesterday, less than tomorrow. Always.</p>
